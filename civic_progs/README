Overview
========

There are three binaries in the toolchain:

- The compiler "civcc", which compiles CiviC source code to assembly source

- The assembler "civas", which compiles assembly source to an object file that
  can be run by the VM.

- The virtual machine "civvm", which runs one or more object files, one of
  which should export a "main" function.

Additionally, there is a run script "civrun" which takes one file name argument
and runs it through the entire pipeline, deleting intermediate files
afterwards. E.g. for the first assignment you may want to run:
$ bin/civrun euclid.cvc
Please enter an integer value: 60
Please enter an integer value: 45
15

Or even:
$ echo 60 45 | bin/civrun euclid.cvc 2>&1
15

You may want to add the toolchain directory to your $PATH so you can run the
tools without having to prefix "<...>/bin/" every time when using the
toolchain. E.g. add to your ~/.bashrc:
export PATH=$PATH:<directory_where_you_unpacked_the_toolchain>/bin
